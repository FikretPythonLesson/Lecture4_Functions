def multi(a, b):     # a and b are spaces that must be filled by two numbers
    answer = a * b   # Times a and b and putting it into variable answer
    return answer    # Returning variable answer to caller

q1 = multi(5, 100)   # Create variable q1 and put function multi with 5 replacing a 100
print(q1)            # and 100 replacing b into q1. Finally print q1
